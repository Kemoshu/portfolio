Password Strength Tester is a minimalist, client-side widget—about 1.7 
kB gzipped—that plugs into any signup form to grade passwords instantly 
as users type. Each keystroke is analyzed for length, character-class diversity, 
and matches against a 20 k+ blacklist; the widget then displays an entropy-based score and plain-English tips that nudge users 
toward stronger secrets. Written in vanilla JavaScript with zero external dependencies, 
it works out of the box in any modern browser, gracefully degrades when JavaScript is disabled, 
and can be embedded with a single <script> tag or bundled as a Web Component for framework-agnostic reuse.
